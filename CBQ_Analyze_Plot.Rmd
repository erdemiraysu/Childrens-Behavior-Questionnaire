## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra) # for multiple bar graphs in a grid
```

# Specify Main folder path
# Once you update the path for the folder, no change is needed for the rest of the codes:

```{r}
# Specify the main folder path - for reading the output data from CBQ_gather_clean_proprocess and writing the output
main_path <- "/Users/aysuerdemir/Desktop/CBQ_EDA/"
```

# LOAD DATA
```{r}
# Load DataSet: 

CBQ_scored <- read.csv(file = paste0(main_path, "CBQ_scored.csv")) %>%
  select(-X)# Remove the added X variable after reading it back into R:
head(CBQ_scored)

```

# AGE, GENDER COUNT SUMMARY
```{r}
# Give Age, Gender and Count Summary Statistics for each Group:
CBQ_age_gender_summary <- 
  CBQ_scored %>%
  group_by(talkergroup) %>%
summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    male_gender_count = sum(gender, na.rm = TRUE),  # because male = 1, female = 0
    SD_age = sd(gender, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count_kids = n_distinct(subject)
    )
```

# CREATE TWO HISTOGRAMS FOR AGE DISTRIBUTION IN CWS AND CWNS
